        <h2>Fruits</h2>
        <p>Here is about vegetables too!</p>
        <p>
            Fruit and vegetables should be an important part of your daily diet. 
            They are naturally good and contain vitamins and minerals that can 
            help to keep you healthy. They can also help protect against some diseases.
            Most Australians will benefit from eating more fruit and vegetables as part
            of a well-balanced, healthy diet and an active lifestyle. There are many 
            varieties of fruit and vegetables available and many ways to prepare, cook
            and serve them.
            Fruit and vegetables are best bought when they are in season. Otherwise try 
            frozen or canned vegetables as they are just as nutritious and budget-friendly
            as well.
            You should eat at least 5 serves of vegetables and 2 serves of fruit each day. 
            Choose different colours and varieties.
            If you are someone who doesnâ€™t look forward to eating fruit or vegetables, start 
            slowly with those you do like. Try serving, flavouring or cooking them in different
            ways. You can also disguise them in sauces, minced meals or curries.
